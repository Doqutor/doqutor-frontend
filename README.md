# Doqutore Frontend

> Doqutore is built with Vue as the javascript framework, Vuetify as the component library and Nuxt as the server-side rendering framework. It uses the exposed HTTPS endpoints from AWS Lambdas functions for the API calls and also uses Github Actions for CI/CD deployments to AWS S3 buckets.

## Manual deployment

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn
